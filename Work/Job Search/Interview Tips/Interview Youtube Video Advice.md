##### Amazon Interview Preparation in 10 Steps
###### 1. List career history stories
- Chat with ex colleagues
- Things you did, projects, launches, products, anything you delivered that you're proud of
	- Write down everything you can think of
- Study leadership principles
- >10 stories

###### 2. Study leadership principles

###### 3. Identify 1-2 of leadership principles that resonate with each career example

###### 4. Look at the job description
- Hiring managers list which are key for the job
- Sometimes explicitly named, otherwise infer from language
- Go through and identify which principles are key for the job
	- More times alluded, more on the top of their mind it is

###### 5. Try and match between identified principles and stories found/identified
- See where you have stories for principles, and where there are gaps
- If there are gaps, challenge yourself to see if there's a way I can shape my great stories to that leadership principle

###### 6. Look at the Gaps, what LPs missing
- What you're missing but also what the JD is missing
- Each will have 8-10 key leadership principles, 6-8 left to prepare for

###### 8. Editing
- Look at STARI story, ask if anything doesn't add to:
	- Context
		- Not important to know to understand story
	- Doesn't show behavior
- Edit out, just a waste of words
- What's the right length? 
	- No one right length, simply right length for that example

###### 9. Develop answers for introductory questions
- Influence decision to move you forward in early rounds
- Examples
	- Why ???
	- Why this role?
	- Tell me about yourself
	- Walk me through your resume
- Come up with some answers
- Length?
	- More depth in early rounds than later
		- 2 min in early
		- No more than 1 min for later rounds

###### 10. Practice a shit ton
- Enormous value in mock interview
- Practice on own, record self, listen back
	- Um/ah don't matter
	- Talking quickly or forgetting something important may be an issue
	- You won't notice if you're saying to yourself
