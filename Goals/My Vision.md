Where do I see myself in 3 to 5 years?
What kind of impact do I want to have?
What size of company do I want to work at?
How much money do I want to be making?
What is my passion?

7/29/22:
    I see myself married to Lily with at least our first child and three dogs, in our first home. I see myself having a good work and life balance, focusing on work during hours and focusing on my family afterward and on weekends, around 40-50 hours a week. I see myself as having a balance between my personal interests and my family responsibilities outside of work, part of some other community for myself but not in any leadership or overly stressful position. I will sacrifice time and effort for my family but not to the extent that I lose my own identity or my passions. If I find myself without enough to give to my own standards, I will find a way with the support of those around me to reduce one of my responsibilities. “Better to full ass one thing than to half ass two”. 

    I see myself as having a good understanding of my emotions and my thought patterns and having a greater focus on the present. Even when facing high-pressure situations or daunting future tasks, I will focus on doing my best at that moment and be able to experience my emotions without them overwhelming me. I will understand what self-love really means to me and be a true supporter of myself no matter how bad a day is. I will understand my values and have a true direction and purpose in my life because of them, and not falter from these values. 

    I see myself as a specialized professional in my career field and focused on a clear purpose/mission, perhaps a specific underserved community. I see myself working closely with the people I’m trying to help and being able to see how my work is impacting them. I see my work and my management/team as giving me flexibility, but also challenging me and giving me room to learn and grow. Perhaps in a newer field and one that changes with new problems to explore. I want to be in a small to mid-sized company with a strong mission and community and inspired co-workers and make $150,000. Not management, but specialized work that I can be an expert in and contribute to in a meaningful way. 

    Some good examples of these underserved communities are people with disabilities, homeless people, immigrant populations, and the elderly. People with disabilities need many particular aiding tools, but I am less inclined to work on the technology presented here right now. Homeless people are a group I would very much like to help. A specific area I was very passionate about in college was access to proper resources for minorities or lower-income families. This could be access to healthcare, access to education and motivating resources, or access to mental health resources. 

    Another field I would be interested in working in would be aiding scientific research in some environmental or healthcare-related field. I am passionate about our impact on the environment and also about many under-focused areas of science as well.

    I used to be very interested in pursuing some kind of medical CS job but realized quickly that the industry is mostly building apps for doctors and hospital staff to use but rarely to help patients directly.
