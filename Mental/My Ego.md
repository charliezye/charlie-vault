### Taiwanese Cultural Values

#### Confucius
##### Asia Society
>>Only when things are investigated is knowledge extended; only when knowledge is extended are thoughts sincere; only when thoughts are sincere are minds rectified; only when minds are rectified are the characters of persons cultivated; only when character is cultivated are our families regulated; only when families are regulated are states well governed; only when states are well governed is there peace in the world.
- Against the grain of legalistic mind set at the time
- Used to encourage "filial sons" and "chaste wives"
	- Respect for parents
	- Loyalty to government
	- Keeping to one's place in society
- **Humaneness** (ren) was the other side 
	- Source of all virtue
>>Thus if the "outer"side of Confucianism was conformity and acceptance of social roles, the "inner" side was cultivation of conscience and character. Cultivation involved broad education and reflection on one's actions. It was a lifetime commitment to character building carving and polishing the stone of one's character until it was a **lustrous gem.**

>>"At fifteen, I set my heart on learning. At thirty, I was firmly established. At forty, I had no more doubts. At fifty, I knew the will of heaven. At sixty, I was ready to listen to it. At seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing what was right. Analects, 2:4" - Kong Fuzi

>>Until the 1890s, serious-minded Chinese saw Confucianism, despite its failures to realize its ideal society, as the source of hope for China and the core of what it meant to be Chinese.
- The People's Republic has publicly abandoned his teachings
	- Maoism teaches a commitment to transforming the world by applying the lessons of autopian ideology to the actions and institutions of everyday life


##### Stanford Interpretation
- Kong Fuzi
- Philosophy historically undermined
	- A diversity of representations and concerns
	- Strands of which were later differentially selected and woven together by interpreters intent on **appropriating** or **condemning** **particular associated views and traditions**
- Three interconnected areas
	1. A psychology of ritual that describes how ideal social forms regulate individuals
	2. An ethics rooted in the cultivation of a set of personal virtues
	3. A theory of society and politics based on normative views of the family and the state

##### Random Notes
>>As a Chinese individual, you are expected to live up to more Confucian ideals, the view that education will promise you a good job in life, that you will be obedient and respect authority without much question. Yet, as an American itseems to be much more free-spirited and you end up stuck in this rut of how to work with these different cultures. You want to have more freedom, but you don't want to disappoint your parents who will literally pour money into SAT prep, and drill you to the ground with work in the hopes that you will make them proud. But what do you do when American values clash with the values of your family? If you please your parents, you’re unhappy, but if you don’t please them, they’re unhappy.
