Strong, clear, concise communication is critical for Amazon candidates. Try using “I” statements instead of “we” or “as a group”

Consider asking questions about their team and organization, process improvements, Amazon culture, career path, etc.  This is your chance to ensure Amazon is a good fit for you!

**STAR METHOD:** We focus on behavioral interviewing (“Give me an example of a time when…”, “Tell me about a specific project when…”) in order to better understand the granular details of your experience and how you work.  When you are thinking about your answers, please use the “S.T.A.R” method for organizing your responses.  Our goal is to understand the full, end to end explanation of whatever project or challenge you are discussing. i.e., we want to understand the “Situation”, “Task”, “Action” and “Result”.  The interviewers will ask follow-up questions to ensure we are collecting all of the data that we need about that specific answer.

• Situation – set the context for your story. For example, "We were due to be delivering a presentation to a group of 30 interested industry players on our new product and Stuart, the guy due to deliver it, got stuck on a train from Birmingham."

• Task – what was required of you. For example, "It was my responsibility to find an alternative so it didn't reflect badly on the company and we didn't waste the opportunity."

• Action – what you actually did. For example, "I spoke to the event organizers to find out if they could change the running order. They agreed so we bought ourselves some time. I contacted Susan, another member of the team, who at a push could step in. She agreed to drop what she was doing and head to the event."

• Result – how well the situation played out. For example, "Stuart didn't make the meeting on time but we explained the problem to the delegates and Susan's presentation went well – a bit rough around the edges but it was warmly received. Stuart managed to get there for the last 15 minutes to answer questions. As a result we gained some good contacts, at least two of which we converted into paying clients."

2.  **Read+ Write:**

-   Amazon’s interviews are unique if you haven’t already please review specifics with [Interviewing at Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/interviewing-at-amazon)
-   Be sure to have **multiple examples** ready! Try to diversify your examples as much as possible, so we can best understand your scope and the big initiatives/projects you have lead.
-   Try to think of examples with a lot of detail because there will always be follow-up questions.
-   **Metrics, metrics, metrics**! Amazon is extremely data driven, be sure to quantify your results and how you were able to measure your success.
-   Ownership and the ability to self-critically reflect on process, outcomes, and continuous improvement.
-   Ability to operate effectively in an ambiguous environment.
-   If you get stuck on a question, try using the phrase “That’s a great question, can I have a minute to think about it?”. Your interviewer will happily give you a few moments to collect your thoughts.
-   **Customer Obsession** is at the heart of everything we do, so **it’s always a good idea to start with the customer and work backwards**. Our customers are why we come to work every day and are the reason we do what we do. To understand your commitment to customers we need to hear you talk about customers, advocate for them, and champion them. We are truly obsessed with our customers at Amazon and want to know you are too, so please remember to talk about customers in every interview. 
-   **Questions for Interviewers** – These are high level leaders, they have a lot of experience and are the SMEs of their areas.  Questions like next steps, start dates, location, etc., leave those questions for me.  Instead, consider asking questions about their team and organization, process improvements, Amazon culture, career path, etc.  This is your chance to ensure Amazon is a good fit for you!
-   Lastly – **Why do you really want to join Amazon?** Do some research / have some examples of what motivates you about this role, what Amazon is doing, and why you’re willing to take the career move to join Amazon.
