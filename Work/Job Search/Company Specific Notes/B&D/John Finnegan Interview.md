-   Need someone with an entrepreneurial/start up mentality with vision for the position and company success.
-   This will be employee #1 internally from an engineering perspective. They would like someone to come in and own the development, but also have strategic vision for the future.
-   All of the development thus far has been done by an external agency (Yonder Agency) and this individual will oversee the external agency, quarterbacking everything as it pertains to B&D Industrial and the OptiPro SaaS Product.
-   They need someone with strong communications skills, poise, and the ability to challenge/make recommendations on technologies to the folks at Yonder Agency, while communicating with leadership, stakeholders, and customers to illicit the correct requirements to improve the product.

I understand if it may be a concern that I'm young, especially for a role of this breadth. However, I see my age as a point of strength. I'm experienced but eager to learn, unencumbered by bad habits, adaptable, and innovative. I believe you’d be hard-pressed to find another candidate who both matches your needs and is as enthusiastic, forward-focused, and ready to build this team’s culture as I am.

Overall, I've always focused on pushing my organizations toward sustained success. I'm hard-working and dependable guy, and I would adjust at a fast pace and begin contributing immediately. As a quarterback, I’ve got the poise to be a leader in your locker room and the skills to execute the game plan, and I’d love a chance to start on your team.
