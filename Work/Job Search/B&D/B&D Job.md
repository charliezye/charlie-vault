- How much of the future vision of the product will be in my hands?
	- With regards to implementation decisions leading to intended outcomes
	- With regards to internal application architecture/team decisions

###### What it is now:

Unstructured set of individual codes/scripts

 **What does this entail?**
- Saw on rebranding press release that it is labeled as cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid-cloud platform
	- Are there already some cloud capabilities? 

**Currently sell/install this software with 4-5 hours**
- Who sells/installs? Company employee or Yonder Group?
- How involved is this process?
- How much difference between customers, any way to more easily streamline?
- Is there data your company collects from individual customers that can be used for internal analysis/improvements?

**Script chosen based on device to aggregate code/data?**
- How involved is this process? How much code is in each script?
- How has Blue Yonder set you up for transitional success?
	- Is there already internal documentation on the application?
- How does your pipeline/architecture look right now?
	- Django Model View Template (MVT)
- What's the backend built in?
- Is the goal microservices? API pipelines?
	- Is there any machine learning you plan to/are already involving?

**Is data stored on local database servers right now?**
- How is data collected from machines and sent to server?
- How is data queried and returned to application?
- Is there any caching currently involved with Redis or other frameworks?
	- Seems like high throughput, want fast response/low latency
	- Lot of old data to display that doesn't need to be re-queried

**Measuring Efficiency of App**
- How has efficiency of application itself been measured internally?
	- Runtime of queries, time to load page/data visualizations, etc.
- How is ROI measued?

###### Outcome: MVP to launch into marketplace

**Why did you choose to create OptiPro as a software solution to sell to other companies?**
- Will this compete with other SAAS platform solutions in your industry?
- Any difficulties with adapting to certain machinery or issues selling to companies with proprietary IIOT SAAS or is this not really a problem? What sets this application apart?
- Market analysis?

**What's the scope of this first endeavor? Timeline?**
- Is timeline to MVP 6-7 months? 
- How much additional work will be involved with implementing application from current state to cloud state?
- Is it just translating to microservices and hosting on the cloud?
- Are there new features?
- What plans for working to move away from Blue Yonder and build own team?
	- Timeline?

###### Vision I Present to You

Overall, vision is to provide a secure, scalable, efficient, and comprehensive product that satisfies customer needs and meets management expectations.

Not to give away the whole farm, but:

1. Device/Actuators
2. Network Layer
	1. Field gateways to pass information from devices to DB
	2. LPWAN, Cellular, Zigbee?
3. AWS Cloud Hosting Solution
	1. Databases:
		1. "Data lake" for all your raw data from sensors
			1. Good if need to analyze data against other data before storing
			2. OR Edge devices 
				1. Store and process data close to its source, only sending a part of the generated records to the data warehouse on the cloud
				3. Can save a lot of time/resources otherwise used to send raw data to cloud
		2. "Cloud gateways" for compression and entry of important information to cloud
			1. Transform, filter, and aggregate data before sending to data warehouse, e.g. changing formatting
		3. "Data warehouse" to store insightful data
		5. Data analytics in AWS and in backend to analyze issues/bugs in process
		6. Caching with Elasticache, Cloudfront, Route 53
4. Whichever backend framework you're using
	1. All your complex data querying and analytics for data used in visualizations and presentation to users
	2. Django most likely, consider Java and NodeJS as well
6. Angular Frontend for user applications/touchpoints
7. Long term: 
	1. Machine learning to customize functionalities, analyze devices, and extract big data trends across customers
	2. Not sure if this is applicable, but use of smart phones, smart watches or other wearables for workers
		1. These have a ton of sensors built in and I've worked with them between Ubiquitous Computing and work w/ Ware2Go

Why is this plan important?
1. Maintainability
2. Scalability
3. Cost-efficiency
4. High/quick performance
5. Interoperability
6. Security
How does it accomplish this?
- Microservices, modularization
- Clear division of labor among steps and prioritization of important data
- No storage of parts that are not useful

###### Backend Architecture Examination

- Java and Node.js are generally faster than Python
	- During compilation are generally faster due to not dynamic typing
	- Up to 10x faster
- Java has much faster performance
	- 10x+ less CPU seconds for Java/Node.js vs. Python
	- On Amazon servers, EC2 pricing is based around compute capacity so this would save a lot of money
- These play a big role in scalability as codebase grows

1. Django MVT
	- Like MVC but template instead of view and view instead of controller
	1. Model
		1. SQL DB
	2. View
		1. Takes web requests, returns web response
		2. Render HTML/CSS/JS into what you see on web page 
		3. Equivalent of Controller in MVC
	4. Template
		1. Static parts of HTML and dynamic content
		2. Equivalent of view in MVC

#### Questions about John Finnegan 

Would love to hear more about your experience at Rittal and what inspired you to come to B&D to head up their IIoT solutions, saw you had over 20 years of experience there

- Seems like a great company you had built yourself from the ground up in, have a lot of admiration for that as someone who has tried to navigate college and life independently
- Read that you had responsibility for "entire US industrial market", including emergent software
- Is this a competitor?
	- Saw they mainly work in climate control and their IoT offerings are in that so curious if you wanted greater breadth in IIoT with general B2B platform
- What insights did you bring and what do you think is necessary for success in the IoT field?
- Acquisition of GTI predictive
	- Do they mainly only work on VibePro or are they also involved with OptiPro?
	- Mainly curious if they will be providing machine learning solutions
