- "You can't make it 75 years without loyal customers. We've had to evolve and offer different services and products and a lot of it is derived from culture of taking care of customers and drive that comes with that. When you're trying to sell applications and solve customer problems the institutional knowledge of the vertical markets and industries is the value we can bring. IoT is the modernization of customer service and looks different from years ago. IoT's about data so customers can be smarter about their work and we try to provide to all our customers."
