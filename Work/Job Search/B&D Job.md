#### Optipro
- Gathers data in 5 most common coding languages and combines into cohesive dashboard

How old is the OptiPro product now?
- Saw that TM was filed in August


##### What do you want optipro to become?

###### Now: Unstructured set of individual codes/scripts

###### What does this entail?

**Script chosen based on device to aggregate code/data?**
- How involved is this process? How much code is in each script?
- How does your pipeline/architecture look right now?
	- MVC, 
- Is the goal microservices? 

**Is data stored on local database servers right now?**
- How is data collected from machines and sent to server?
- How is data queried and returned to application?
- Is there any caching currently involved with Redis or other frameworks?
	- Seems like high throughput, want fast response/low latency
	- Lot of old data to display that doesn't need to be re-queried
	- Session store


- How has efficiency of application itself been measured internally?
	- Runtime of queries, time to load page/data visualizations, etc.
- How is ROI measued?
- Outcome: MVP to launch into marketplace
	- Clearly want cloud solution
