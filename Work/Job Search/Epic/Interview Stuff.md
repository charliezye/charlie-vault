#### Important Issues
- Care mobility/scalability
- Insufficient focus on patients

#### Questions
- How does Epic design systems considering diverse patient populations like people with disabilities?
- How much customization between clients? What roles that handle communication with them?
- Role expectations for me? Will I be mostly maintaining and improving existing applications or developing new ones? 
	- How much flexibility with moving between development teams?
- How much does Epic focus on regulatory compliance for apps especially AI/ML?
	- What's the process look like for this? Do developers have to completely handle compliance or is there help with this?
- Saw on your DEI page that Epic offers tools to identify and address health disparities. I think health equity is incredibly important for underserved populations
	- Perinatal Equity, Sex, Gender, and Names,
	- How much of a focus is Epic putting into developing new tools like this? There are a lot more tools that could benefit immensely in such a connected network like Epic's. Capability to work on these?
	- Is there research done into any unintended adverse effects software may have?
