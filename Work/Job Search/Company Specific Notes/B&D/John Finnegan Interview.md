[GO BIG](https://www.bdindustrial.com/CoreValues)

-   Need someone with an entrepreneurial/start up mentality with vision for the position and company success.
-   This will be employee #1 internally from an engineering perspective. They would like someone to come in and own the development, but also have strategic vision for the future.
-   All of the development thus far has been done by an external agency (Yonder Agency) and this individual will oversee the external agency, quarterbacking everything as it pertains to B&D Industrial and the OptiPro SaaS Product.
-   They need someone with strong communications skills, poise, and the ability to challenge/make recommendations on technologies to the folks at Yonder Agency, while communicating with leadership, stakeholders, and customers to illicit the correct requirements to improve the product.


## My Pitch

1. Colin reached out to me, spoke over the phone, he really sold me on the position and vision you had, I'd really love to work together on this
2. Intro
	1. Family man, high school sweetheart and 3 dogs
	2. Parents at UGA for 30 years, B&Dfamily & employee owned
	3. Impart one impression - Pride, care, and accountability in my work and community
3. Ownership and pride from building something and seeing its impact
	1. Accountability
	2. Sense of trust and mutual respect with customers and people you work with
	3. Always harped on this, number one focus

Love a good technical challenge and the problem-solving process, exploring and learning about new technologies, balancing use of industry standards and new innovative options

4. Lead engineering and Cloud transition
	1. Royall - designed and built backend, deployed to AWS
	2. Angel Oak - Machine learning data pipeline in Azure
	3. Boeing - Full-stack, height of COVID-19
	4. Highly interpretable, scalable, and flexible
	5. Encompasses AWS, Python, Angular
6. Management skills/End-to-end product experience
	1. sergeant leading missions and campaigns for five years
	2. MVP, business case, and upper management presentation for an emergent B2B solution with Ware2Go
	3. I’ve excelled at balancing client needs with management vision to produce results for local nonprofits with Bits of Good. 
		1. Recruited and mentored product managers now at Facebook/Microsoft
	4. These experiences lend me an ability to discern secondary variables important for product success and the soft skills to build a great team around me.

I understand if it may be a concern that I'm young, especially for a role of this breadth. However, I see my age as a point of strength. I'm experienced but eager to learn, unencumbered by bad habits, adaptable, and innovative. I believe you’d be hard-pressed to find another candidate who both matches your needs and is as enthusiastic, forward-focused, and ready to build this team’s culture as I am.

Overall, I've always focused on pushing my organizations toward sustained success. I'm hard-working and dependable guy, and I would adjust at a fast pace and begin contributing immediately. As a quarterback, I’ve got the poise to be a leader in your locker room and the skills to execute the game plan, and I’d love a chance to start on your team.
