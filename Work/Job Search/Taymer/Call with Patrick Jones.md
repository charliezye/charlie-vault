#### Taymer

##### Mission:
>> Continuously build, maintain and improve in-line and offline products for manufacturers. Empower our customers with easy-to-use reliable equipment to maximize production and results.

##### Features
- Detect surface defects
- Detect diameter defects
- **Identify poor print quality and missing print**
- **Measure print legend interval and re-calibrate print distance**
- Find cable wrapping defects
- Measure wrapping distance, angle, surface features
- Inspect surface color quality

##### Printer Types
- Hot Foil
- Indent/Emboss
- Hot stamping
- New plans
	- Dot matrix inkjet?
		- Issues with this

- HF 2000 hotfoil printer
- SI3100 and SI4100
  - Surround product and take images of everything

#### Competitors
  - Sikora
	  - Saw they use purely dual sensor technology light/laser tech for surface defects
	  - Heard from Lively this can be an issue with various obstructions
  - Keyence 
	  - Says they have OCR for rechargeable automotive battery label and electronic PCBs
	  - Machine vision difficulty can be lighting conditions
	  - Vision Sensor with Built-in AI

#### Verification Technology

##### Print verification
  - Templated
    - Signal at regular interval to tell what to print and when
  - Final image generated from thousands of images
	  - Template image to compare against
  - OCV - Object character verification
    - Difficulties
      - Clear image is difficult to get
      - Product moving fast, dot matrix from inkjet printers and UV curer instead of hotfoil
        - Physical imprint (heated drum, pigmented tape) vs. UV chamber vs. Sprayed on

- Languages
  - C++
  - Computer vision
- Print verification
  - Threshold/template image
  - Compare against threshold image
  - Templates of bad images
    - Room for user error
    - New template at each new product run
      - New print legend
- No data handed off back
  - Stand alone

- Print length verification
  - Measures distance between prints
  - 2+ camera system
    - 2, 3, 5 feet between cameras
  - Template just looking at letter S
    - Very small section
    - Measure small box in same distance from focal point and how far offset in image is from one to the other

- SI3100
  - Product dirty
  - Camera obstructions
  - Defect images vs. other images like dirt, dust, water droplets, flies
  - Collecting data for this

#### Questions

##### Printer

**Where do Taymer products come in during cable manufacturing process?**
- After extrusion during cabling or after cabling?
	- I understand there are many wires wrapped

**Where would my role come in?**
- Understand Taymer wants to move to complete OCR/OCV
	- Possibly overcome issues with threshold/template images right now
- What has already been attempted/done to address these issues?
- Am I primarily troubleshooting and traveling to sell/install, or will I be able to focus on the more innovative machine learning endeavors?
	- Have a lot of machine learning experience and experience with OCR

**Future plans for Taymer?**
- Dot matrix printers?
- Heard defect mis-identifications are an issue and machine learning has been considered as a solution
	- Is this a project that may be pursued?
- Lot of flexibility of what to work on
- 1 week a month travel
- 1 month in Canada
	- 2 meetings a year a week long in Canada
- Troubleshooting split
	- On a customer to customer basis
	- No real ticketing system
	- Southwire, other Benjamin's clients
		- Reach out because personal connection or assigned by Pat
		- If focusing on development, can keep in mind
- Location lock?
	- Most of customers in the South
	- Some in California
- Did use to sell inkjet printers
	- Expensive, a pain, stopped doing
- Area of growth is vision related
	- Machine learning
- A lot of independence/flexibility
	- Bit of an island

##### Culture Fit
- Work-life balance?
- Travel percentage?
- Challenges/room for growth?

##### Logistics
- Training in Canada?
- General communication and what to expect day-to-day
