My pitch

I’m a family man first, homegrown born and raised in Athens Georgia, lived in Atlanta for five years and just moved back to be closer to family, currently living with my high school sweetheart in a small house with our three dogs. 

My parents are immigrants and have worked in research at UGA for over 30 years and taught me the importance of hard work and loyalty to good management. I know your company is family run and employee owned which immediately stood out to me and rings true with my personal core values.

I’ve currently been taking a few months off to handle some family and personal hardships, but I’m inspired and ready to enter the next step in my career. 

In terms of work experience, I’m a software engineering professional with almost three years of full-time experience in corporate and entrepreneurial roles. I have five years of military service as a sergeant and the experience and leadership that comes with that. 

First, to get this out of the way, I understand if it may be a concern that I'm young, especially for a role of this breadth. However, I see my age as a point of strength. I'm experienced but eager to learn, unencumbered by bad habits, adaptable, and innovative. I believe you’d be hard-pressed to find another candidate that both matches your needs and is as enthusiastic, forward-thinking, and possessing as much room to grow while building this team’s culture as I am. 

Let me share with you three reasons why I’m your guy for this role. 

First I’d like to talk the importance of ownership. This is something I’ve always harped on with my soldiers, mentees, fellow developers and product managers. My favorite feeling in the world is solving problems, building something, and having that sense of pride in my work. With that sense of pride also comes accountability and responsibility for both successes and mistakes. You own your accomplishments and deserve praise but also accept and rectify your shortcomings. That in my mind leads to and encompasses the number one focus of my management style which is building a sense of trust and mutual respect with the people you work with. 

Second, my technical expertise. I’ve conceptualized, designed and built software from the ground up and deployed it to the cloud at Royall Technologies. I’ve worked in large existing code bases and integrated APIs into existing IT cloud pipelines at Angel Oak. I’ve quickly built full-stack applications on a short staffed, high intensity IT team at the height of pandemic layoffs at Boeing. I’ve learned the importance of scalability, flexibility, and just good communication and documentation skills. All of this in the stack you’re looking for - AWS, Python, Angular.

Finally, my management and end to end product experience. I’ve worked on a full software MVP, business case/deployment plan, and presentation to upper management for a B2B platform with Ware2Go, a large UPS-backed startup, and had the best presentation of our cohort. I’ve recruited/interviewed, taught, and mentored product managers that have gone on to work as PMs at Microsoft and Facebook with bits of good. I’ve directed product lifecycles, balancing the needs of nonprofit clients with management vision and development capabilities and produced real-world useful applications. Finally, I’ve led military missions, mentored soldiers, and taken various initiatives to build to future of my army unit. Overall I've always focused on setting up organizations I've led and been a part of for future sustained success and smooth transitions.

  

  

You may view Bits of Good as less corporate focused, but we followed industry standards Agile development practices from Microsoft and Google. All of this with teams of students who at GT are notorious for never having enough time to work on non-school projects,
