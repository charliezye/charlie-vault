- "You can't make it 75 years without loyal customers. We've had to evolve and offer different services and products and a lot of it is derived from culture of taking care of customers and drive that comes with that. When you're trying to sell applications and solve customer problems the institutional knowledge of the vertical markets and industries is the value we can bring. IoT is the modernization of customer service and looks different from years ago. IoT's about data so customers can be smarter about their work and we try to provide to all our customers."

- Help sensors, remote in, see how it's performing. True expertise is creating value for customers around products.

#### Linda Miller
- 1975-2019 worked at B&D
- Started typing and filing
- IBM education center for programming in 1978
- Hired by original Mr. Nations
- So many employees became like family


#### Future Innovative Focus
- Bringing in John, Mike Rine, other industry experts into senior leadership to guide innovation and new product development
	- Acquisitions like GTI predictive
	- Considering young talent like myself

#### Employee Loyalty and Company Identity/Culture
- Continuing culture of family and customer focus with a willingness to change and innovate
- Promoting within with Billy Grimes, empowering employees through education like Linda Miller and Raymond at IBM Education Center and motivating them to stay long-term, and giving employees a stake in the success of the company
	- I think this kind of culture isn't present in nearly any of the companies most Georgia Tech CS graduates seek out, and I'd love an opportunity to be a part of the B&D family
