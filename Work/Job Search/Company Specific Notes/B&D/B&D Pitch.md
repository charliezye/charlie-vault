My pitch

I’m a family man first, homegrown born and raised in Athens Georgia, lived in Atlanta for five years and just moved back to be closer to family, planning on marrying my high school sweetheart and current living together in a small house with our three dogs

My parents are immigrants and have worked in research at UGA for over 30 years and taught me the importance of hard work, dedication, and loyalty to good management. I know your company is family run and employee owned which immediately stood out to me and that rings true with my personal core values. I’ve stayed community focused in both Athens and Atlanta and always make sure to vote and participate in various community organizations. 

I’ve currently been taking a few months off to handle some family and personal hardships, but I’ve been working on bettering myself and my skills in my free time and I’m inspired and ready to enter the next step in my career. 

In terms of work experience, I’m a software engineering professional with almost three years of experience in corporate and entrepreneurial roles as well as several years in development roles working my way through college. I have five years of military service currently as a sergeant and the experience and leadership that comes with that. 

First, to get this out of the way, I understand if may be a concern that I am young, especially for a role of this breadth and the path to higher management positions. However, I see my age as a point of strength. I’ve worked with, learned from, and mentored people of all ages in my short career - the military is a great example as a 23 year old sergeant with a 28 year old married subordinate. I believe you’d be hard-pressed to find another candidate that both matches your needs and is as enthusiastic, forward-thinking, and possessing as much room to grow with and build this team’s culture as I am. 

Let me share with you three reasons why I’m your guy for this role. 

First I’d like to talk the importance of ownership to me. This is something I’ve always harped on with my soldiers, mentees, fellow developers and project managers. My favorite feeling in the world is solving problems, building something, and having that sense of pride in my work. When I cook or make art, I wouldn’t hand over something I wouldn’t eat or hang up myself, and I feel the same way about my career goals. With that sense of pride also comes accountability and responsibility for actions, success or mistakes. You own your accomplishments and deserve praise but also accept and rectify your shortcomings. That in my mind leads to and encompasses the number one focus of my management style which is building a sense of trust and mutual respect with the people you work with. 

Second, my technical expertise. I’ve conceptualized, designed and built software from the ground up and deployed it to the cloud at Royall Technologies. I’ve worked in large existing code bases and created/integrated APIs into existing IT cloud pipelines at Angel Oak. I’ve built full-stack applications on blazing quick timelines on a short staffed, high intensity IT team at the height of pandemic layoffs at Boeing. All of this in the stack you’re looking for - AWS, Python, Angular. I’ve learned the importance of scalability, flexibility, and just good communication and documentation skills. Your work means nothing if someone else can’t pick it up after you and continue it. 

Finally, my management and end to end product experience. I’ve worked on a full software MVP, business case/deployment plan, and presentation to upper management for a B2B platform with Ware2Go, a large UPS-backed startup, and had the best presentation of our cohort. I’ve recruited/interviewed, taught, and mentored product managers that have gone on to work as PMs at Microsoft and Facebook with bits of good. I’ve directed product lifecycles, balancing the needs of nonprofit clients with management vision and development capabilities and produced real-world useful applications. Finally, I’ve led military missions, mentored soldiers, and taken various initiatives to build to future of my army unit. Overall I've always focused on setting up organizations I've led and been a part of for future sustained success and smooth transitions.

  

  

You may view Bits of Good as less corporate focused, but we followed industry standards Agile development practices from Microsoft and Google. All of this with teams of students who at GT are notorious for never having enough time to work on non-school projects,
