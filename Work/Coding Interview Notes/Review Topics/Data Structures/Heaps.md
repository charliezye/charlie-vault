#### Goals 
The following goals are general goals included as an outline every data structure. Some data structures may have sections that are different than the goals shown here.
1) Understand the structure of each and how they conceptually function
2) Learn how to implement the data structure itself
3) Learn how basic operations function, how to implement them, and their space/time complexity
	1) Traversal
	2) Insertion    
	3) Deletion
	4) Searching
	5) Sorting
	6) Merging
4) More Complex Operations
5) Other factors to consider
6) Understand what they are good and bad at and when to use them

### 1) Structure/Function

Heaps are a special tree-based data structure that is a complete binary tree.

There are two specific types of heaps:
1. Max-Heap
	- Key at root node must be greatest among all of its children
	- Must be recursively true for all sub-trees
2. Min-Heap
	- Key at root node must be smallest among all of its children
	- Must be recursively true for all sub-trees

### 2) Implementation



### 3) Basic Operations

#### Heapify


#### Insertion


#### Deletion


#### Searching


#### 4) Other Operations
