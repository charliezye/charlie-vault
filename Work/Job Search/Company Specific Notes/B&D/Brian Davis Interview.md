- "You can't make it 75 years without loyal customers. We've had to evolve and offer different services and products and a lot of it is derived from culture of taking care of customers and drive that comes with that. When you're trying to sell applications and solve customer problems the institutional knowledge of the vertical markets and industries is the value we can bring. IoT is the modernization of customer service and looks different from years ago. IoT's about data so customers can be smarter about their work and we try to provide to all our customers."

Watched B&D Anniversary testimonials on site Yonder Agency made
	Super great to hear how genuine and authentic everyone was and especially hearing B&D customers and partners 

#### Future Innovative Focus
- Bringing in John and Mike Rine into senior leadership to guide innovation and new product development
	- Acquisitions like GTI predictive
	- Considering young talent like myself

#### Employee Loyalty and Company Identity/Culture
- Continuing culture of family, authenticity, and customer focus with a willingness to change and innovate
- Promoting within with employees like Billy Grimes, empowering employees through education like Linda Miller and Raymond Lenderman (used to be a truck driver) at IBM Education Center, and giving employees a stake in the success of the company
	- I think this kind of culture of trust and growth isn't present in nearly any of the companies most Georgia Tech CS graduates seek out, and I'd love an opportunity to be a part of the B&D family

- Bryan Foster pride and problem solving
- HR manager Barbara seems really caring about employees and business itself which I've seen be a lot different at other companies
