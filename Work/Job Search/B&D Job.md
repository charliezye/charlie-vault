	- Industrial weighing
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
	- Ladder logic
- Process Automation Controller (PAC)
	- FPGA
	- Decentralized, able to connect to remote input/output (I/O) and other PACs
- Industrial PC
	- OS like Windows/Linux

**What languages do production machines use?** 
- C, C++, Python, Java?
- G-Code, M-Code, CAM?
- Proprietary?

##### What do you want OptiPro to become?

- What's your long-term vision for the product?
- What's your vision for my involvement and long-term role with the product/future products at your company?
- How much of the future vision of the product will be in my hands?
	- With regards to implementation decisions leading to intended outcomes
	- With regards to internal application architecture/team decisions

###### Now: Unstructured set of individual codes/scripts

###### What does this entail?
- Saw on rebranding press release that it is labeled as cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid-cloud platform
	- Are there already some cloud capabilities? 

**Currently sell/install this software with 4-5 hours**
- Who sells/installs? Company employee or Yonder Group?
- How involved is this process?
- How much difference between customers, any way to more easily streamline?
- Is there data your company collects from individual customers that can be used for internal analysis/improvements?

**Script chosen based on device to aggregate code/data?**
- How involved is this process? How much code is in each script?
- How has Blue Yonder set you up for transitional success?
	- Is there already internal documentation on the application?
- How does your pipeline/architecture look right now?
	- MVC, 
- What's the backend built in?
	- Java and Node.js are generally faster than Python
		- During compilation are generally faster due to not dynamic typing
		- Up to 10x faster
	- Java has much faster performance
		- 10x+ less CPU seconds for Java/Node.js vs. Python
		- On Amazon servers, EC2 pricing is based around compute capacity so this would save a lot of money
	- These play a big role in scalability as codebase grows
- Java
	- Lot of big tech industries use java backend
- Node.js
	- JS backend is newer but commonly used in newer web applications and smaller companies
- Is the goal microservices? API pipelines?
	- Is there any machine learning you plan to/are already involving?

**Is data stored on local database servers right now?**
- How is data collected from machines and sent to server?
- How is data queried and returned to application?
- Is there any caching currently involved with Redis or other frameworks?
	- Seems like high throughput, want fast response/low latency
	- Lot of old data to display that doesn't need to be re-queried
	- Session store

**Measuring Efficiency of App**
- How has efficiency of application itself been measured internally?
	- Runtime of queries, time to load page/data visualizations, etc.
- How is ROI measued?

###### Outcome: MVP to launch into marketplace

**Clearly want cloud-based solution**
- Why was this not originally built on the cloud/with "box" around services?
	- Was use proprietary at first?

**Why did you choose to create OptiPro as a software solution to sell to other companies?**
- Will this compete with other SAAS platform solutions in your industry?
- Any difficulties with adapting to certain machinery or issues selling to companies with proprietary IIOT SAAS? What is the plan to set this application apart?
- Market analysis?

**What's the scope of this first endeavor? Timeline?**
- Is timeline to MVP 6-7 months? 
- How much additional work will be involved with implementing application from current state to cloud state?
- Is it just translating to microservices and hosting on the cloud?
- Are there new features?
- What plans for working to move away from Blue Yonder and build own team?
	- Timeline?

	- August 10, 2022

#### Culture Fit Questions
- Who will I primarily be communicating with to meet needs (who is my top priority client)
	- I assume I am building a product to the specifications of the companies buying it and your company management
	- How will I be assisted in developing management vision into product that also meets needs of customers? 
	- Do you anticipate any particular vision concerns/conflicts that may arise?
