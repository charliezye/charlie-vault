# B&D Industrial Job Notes

- IIOT: Industrial Internet of Things

#### Optipro
- Gathers data in 5 most common coding languages and combines into cohesive dashboard

How old is the OptiPro product now?
- Saw that TM was filed in August

##### About the Application
###### Steps
1. Connect IIOT devices
2. Gather and translate data into one unified dashboard
	1. Internet browser
2. Optimize data into one user interface with various views
	1. Data visualization techniques
2. Custom reporting/alerts
	1. Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio''

###### Features:
1. Remote Monitoring from Any Internet Connection
2. Optimize Throughput with Smarter Resource Allocation
3. Efficiently Capture Data from Multiple Devices
4. Simple Dashboard and Graphics
5. Export Data easily for Advanced Analysis

>>Faster throughput, higher efficiency, reduced operational costs, and less waste

#### Questions about OptiPro

What kind of production machines?
What languages do production machines use?
- C, C++
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
	- Ladder logic
- Process Automation Controller (PAC)
	- FPGA
	- Decentralized, able to connect to remote input/output (I/O) and other PACs

Why did 

##### What do you want optipro to become?

###### Now: Unstructured set of individual codes/scripts

###### What does this entail?

**Script chosen based on device to aggregate code/data?**
- How involved is this process? How much code is in each script?
- How does your pipeline/architecture look right now?
	- MVC, 
- Is the goal microservices? 

**Is data stored on local database servers right now?**
- How is data collected from machines and sent to server?
- How is data queried and returned to application?
- Is there any caching currently involved with Redis or other frameworks?
	- Seems like high throughput, want fast response/low latency
	- Lot of old data to display that doesn't need to be re-queried
	- Session store


- How has efficiency of application itself been measured internally?
	- Runtime of queries, time to load page/data visualizations, etc.
- How is ROI measued?
- Outcome: MVP to launch into marketplace
	- Clearly want cloud solution
