Hey bro,

Some resources that I found invaluable when interview prepping. Everything is centered around Amazon. I found Amazon’s interview structure, the way they teach you to prep, and the answers you develop using the “Amazon method” to be the best by far. If you use this same method for any other company, you will excel in the interview.

-   Interview prep tips from Amazon below:

To better prepare you, please take another look at the job description, review our leadership principles (LP’s) and familiarize yourself with the STAR format. if you’re not already familiar – is a style for answering interview questions that goes a long with when interviewing with any team at the company.   I believe the best strategy to prepare for interview is to take a look at all 14 LP’s and create specific and different examples in STAR format.  This will get you thinking about how they align with your previous experience and help get you in the mindset of how the conversation will go.  Each interviewer will focus on two of them and be listening for your answers to see how closely you follow STAR.  If you would like to talk more about this feel free to let me know and I am more than happy to hop on a quick call ![☺](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/263a/32.png) Remember, your success is our success. Looking forward to hearing how it goes! Good luck!

**Amazon’s Leadership Principles:** Here is a link to check out all 14: Leadership Principles.  [[https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/phone-interview](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/phone-interview)] Examples of interview questions assessing these are below:

1.      Tell me about a time when a resource on your project was falling behind or not delivering. How did you handle this?

2.      Tell me about a time you made a significant professional mistake.  What led you to making the wrong decision?  What would you have done differently in retrospect?  

Please Note: Strong, clear, concise communication is critical for Amazon candidates. Try using “I” statements instead of “we” or “as a group”

**STAR METHOD:** We focus on behavioral interviewing (“Give me an example of a time when…”, “Tell me about a specific project when…”) in order to better understand the granular details of your experience and how you work.  When you are thinking about your answers, please use the “S.T.A.R” method for organizing your responses.  Our goal is to understand the full, end to end explanation of whatever project or challenge you are discussing. i.e., we want to understand the “Situation”, “Task”, “Action” and “Result”.  The interviewers will ask follow-up questions to ensure we are collecting all of the data that we need about that specific answer.

• Situation – set the context for your story. For example, "We were due to be delivering a presentation to a group of 30 interested industry players on our new product and Stuart, the guy due to deliver it, got stuck on a train from Birmingham."

• Task – what was required of you. For example, "It was my responsibility to find an alternative so it didn't reflect badly on the company and we didn't waste the opportunity."

• Action – what you actually did. For example, "I spoke to the event organizers to find out if they could change the running order. They agreed so we bought ourselves some time. I contacted Susan, another member of the team, who at a push could step in. She agreed to drop what she was doing and head to the event."

• Result – how well the situation played out. For example, "Stuart didn't make the meeting on time but we explained the problem to the delegates and Susan's presentation went well – a bit rough around the edges but it was warmly received. Stuart managed to get there for the last 15 minutes to answer questions. As a result we gained some good contacts, at least two of which we converted into paying clients."

2.  **Read+ Write:**

-   Amazon’s interviews are unique if you haven’t already please review specifics with [Interviewing at Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/interviewing-at-amazon)
-   The Hiring Manager has carefully crafted the Job Description to align with the needs of this role.  Review the Basic and Preferred Qualifications and craft examples that showcase your abilities.
-   Review and prepare examples that show how you embody the **Amazon Leadership Principles** (or LPs); you can review them [here](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles).
-   Familiarize yourself with the **S.T.A.R.** interview format (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  This allows us to understand you in detail while capitalizing on the limited time you’ll have to speak with each interviewer. Explain the **S**ituation, the **T**ask at hand, the **A**ctions you took, and the **R**esults you achieved. [https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method)
-   Use **“I”** instead of **“We”**- we want to know what you did not what your team did. Focus on your ownership and contribution in your examples.
-   Be sure to have **multiple examples** ready! Try to diversify your examples as much as possible, so we can best understand your scope and the big initiatives/projects you have lead.
-   Try to think of examples with a lot of detail because there will always be follow-up questions.
-   **Metrics, metrics, metrics**! Amazon is extremely data driven, be sure to quantify your results and how you were able to measure your success.
-   Ownership and the ability to self-critically reflect on process, outcomes, and continuous improvement.
-   Ability to operate effectively in an ambiguous environment.
-   If you get stuck on a question, try using the phrase “That’s a great question, can I have a minute to think about it?”. Your interviewer will happily give you a few moments to collect your thoughts.
-   **Customer Obsession** is at the heart of everything we do, so **it’s always a good idea to start with the customer and work backwards**. Our customers are why we come to work every day and are the reason we do what we do. To understand your commitment to customers we need to hear you talk about customers, advocate for them, and champion them. We are truly obsessed with our customers at Amazon and want to know you are too, so please remember to talk about customers in every interview. 
-   **Questions for Interviewers** – These are high level leaders, they have a lot of experience and are the SMEs of their areas.  Questions like next steps, start dates, location, etc., leave those questions for me.  Instead, consider asking questions about their team and organization, process improvements, Amazon culture, career path, etc.  This is your chance to ensure Amazon is a good fit for you!
-   Lastly – **Why do you really want to join Amazon?** Do some research / have some examples of what motivates you about this role, what Amazon is doing, and why you’re willing to take the career move to join Amazon.
