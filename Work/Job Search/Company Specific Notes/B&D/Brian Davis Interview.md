- "You can't make it 75 years without loyal customers. We've had to evolve and offer different services and products and a lot of it is derived from culture of taking care of customers and drive that comes with that. When you're trying to sell applications and solve customer problems the institutional knowledge of the vertical markets and industries is the value we can bring. IoT is the modernization of customer service and looks different from years ago. IoT's about data so customers can be smarter about their work and we try to provide to all our customers."


## My Pitch

1. John and I spoke the other week and he really sold me on the position and vision B&D has for the future of IIoT, I'd really love to work together on this
3. Intro
	1. Family man, born and raised in Athens, finally back after 5 years in Atlanta and living with high school sweetheart and 3 dogs
	2. Stayed passionate about my local community and spending time giving back to underserved groups like feeding homeless, working with nonprofits, active duty service at food bank
	3. Happy to talk about my technical background and qualifications but if I can leave you with any insight on my character I'd want it to be the pride, care, and accountability I have in my work and community
4. Ownership and pride from building something and seeing its impact
	1. Accountability that comes with that
	2. Breeds sense of trust and mutual respect with customers and people you work with
	3. Always harped on this, number one focus as a part of B&D's IIoT team

Love a problem-solving and a good challenge, exploring and learning about new technologies, balancing innovative risks with proven solutions to meet customer needs

#### To preface
2. Watched B&D Anniversary testimonials on site Yonder Agency made
	- Super great to hear how genuine and authentic everyone was and especially hearing B&D customers and partners 

#### Why B&D?
##### Future Innovative Focus
- Willingness to change and innovate to meet customer needs
	- Heard you speak about that with IoT
	- Bryan Foster (VP gear services) pride and problem solving
- Bringing in John and Mike Rine into senior leadership to guide innovation and new product development
	- Acquisitions like GTI predictive
	- Considering young talent like myself

##### Employee Loyalty and Company Identity/Culture
- Continuing culture of family and authenticity
- Promoting within with employees like Billy Grimes, empowering employees through education like Linda Miller and Raymond Lenderman (used to be a truck driver) at IBM Education Center, and giving employees a stake in the success of the company
	- I think this kind of culture of trust and growth isn't really present in most of the companies most Georgia Tech CS graduates seek out, and I'd love an opportunity to be a part of the B&D family

- HR manager Barbara seems really caring about employees and business itself which I've seen be a lot different at other companies

I understand if it may be a concern that I'm young, especially for a role of this breadth. However, I see my age as a point of strength. I'm experienced but eager to learn, adaptable, and innovative. I believe you’d be hard-pressed to find another candidate who both matches your needs and is as enthusiastic, forward-focused, and ready to build the IIoT team’s culture as I am.

4. Lead engineering and Cloud transition
	1. Royall - designed and built backend, deployed to AWS
	2. Angel Oak - Machine learning data pipeline in Azure
	3. Boeing - Full-stack, height of COVID-19
	4. Highly interpretable, scalable, and flexible
	5. Encompasses AWS, Python, Angular
6. Management skills/End-to-end product experience
	1. sergeant leading missions and campaigns for five years
	2. MVP, business case, and upper management presentation for an emergent B2B solution with Ware2Go
	3. I’ve excelled at balancing client needs with management vision to produce results for local nonprofits with Bits of Good. 
		1. Recruited and mentored product managers now at Facebook/Microsoft
	4. These experiences lend me an ability to discern secondary variables important for product success and the soft skills to build a great team around me.

Overall, I've always focused on pushing my organizations toward sustained success. I'm hard-working and dependable guy, and I would adjust at a fast pace and begin contributing immediately. As a quarterback, I’ve got the poise to be a leader in your locker room and the skills to execute the game plan, and I’d love a chance to start on your team.
