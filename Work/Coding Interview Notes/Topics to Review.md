#### Data Structures:

1. Linked Lists
2. Trees, Tries, & Graphs
3. Stacks & Queues
4. Heaps
5. Vectors/ArrayLists
6. Hash Tables

######Goals:
1. Understand the structure of each and how they conceptually function
2. Learn how to implement the data structure itself
3. Understand how basic operations function
4. Learn how to implement basic operations and their space/time complexity
	1. Traversal
	2. Insertion    
	3. Deletion
	4. Searching
	5. Sorting
	6. Merging
5. Other factors to consider
  - Input: How data will be received
  - Processing: How data is manipulated in the structure (how it's changed to accomodate other data)
  - Maintaining: How data is organized within structure
  - Retrieving: Accessing and returning data
6. Understand what they are good and bad at and when to use them

#### Algorithms:

1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Binary Search
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

###### Goals:
1. Understand conceptually how each of them work.
2. Learn how to implement the algorithm on paper
3. Learn space and time complexity and why
4. Understand what they are good and bad at and when to use them

#### Concepts:

1. Bit Manipulation
2. Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Big O Time & Space
6. Generics 

######Goals:
1. Understand conceptually how each of them work.
2. Learn how to implement them and any operations involved with them. 
3. Understand how they interact with the algorithms and data structures above.
4. Learn what each is good and bad at and when to use them

#### Languages:

Consider learning each of the above in both Python and Java, as this may be very useful for interviews.

###### Goals:
1. Understand advantages and disadvantages in each case in terms of:
  a. Ease of Use
  b. Verbosity
  c. Potential Problems
  d. What operations they struggle with vs. excel at for use in interview
