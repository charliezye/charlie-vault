#### Important Issues
- Care mobility/scalability
- Insufficient focus on patients

#### Questions
- How does Epic design systems considering diverse patient populations like people with disabilities?
- How much customization between clients? What roles that handle communication with them?
- Role expectations for me? Will I be mostly maintaining and improving existing applications or developing new ones?
	- How much flexibility with moving between development teams?
- How much does Epic focus on regulatory compliance for apps especially AI/ML?
	- What's the process look like for this? Do developers have to completely handle compliance or is there help with this?
- Saw on your DEI page that Epic offers tools to identify and address health disparities. I think health equity is incredibly important for underserved populations
	- Perinatal Equity, Sex, Gender, and Names
	- How much of a focus is Epic putting into developing new tools like this? There are a lot more tools that could benefit immensely in such a connected network like Epic's. Capability to work on these?
	- Is there research done into any unintended adverse effects software may have? 

#### ME
 I'm a software engineering professional with 3 years of full-time experience, graduated from Georgia Tech with degree focused in UI/UX and artificial intelligence with a minor in a prestigious management program. 
 
 I'm proficient in languages like Java, Python, JS, I've worked in diverse industries and technical focuses, knowledgeable about full-stack development, machine learning, Agile, software design/architecture, end-to-end product development and lifecycle.
	
- Love a good technical challenge, exploring and learning about new innovative technologies and balancing use of industry standards, feeling of pride and ownership I get when I produce quality work
- Most recently worked to co-found Royall Technologies to build an app in the social media/investment space, since parted ways but looking for a position with in a future focused and highly collaborative development environment that's focused on making a difference and providing quality products for clients.
- Passionate about digital health equity, saw on your DEI page that Epic offers tools to identify and address health disparities like Perinatal Equity app and  Sex, Gender, and Names, and I would love to work with on a team that focuses in that, but overall I believe contributing and encouraging ethical design and patient consideration on Epic solutions would make a big difference for the huge network of organizations and people Epic helps every day
