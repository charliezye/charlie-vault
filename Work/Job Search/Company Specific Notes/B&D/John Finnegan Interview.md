[GO BIG](https://www.bdindustrial.com/CoreValues)

-   Need someone with an entrepreneurial/start up mentality with vision for the position and company success.
-   This will be employee #1 internally from an engineering perspective. They would like someone to come in and own the development, but also have strategic vision for the future.
-   All of the development thus far has been done by an external agency (Yonder Agency) and this individual will oversee the external agency, quarterbacking everything as it pertains to B&D Industrial and the OptiPro SaaS Product.
-   They need someone with strong communications skills, poise, and the ability to challenge/make recommendations on technologies to the folks at Yonder Agency, while communicating with leadership, stakeholders, and customers to illicit the correct requirements to improve the product.

- What made you leave to come to B&D?

Has Optipro been deployed in many manufacturing facilities yet?
